# b2py
Our goal is to transpose the Event-B language and the underlying refinement calculus features into Python for modelling and verification purposes. Event-B is a formal methods language and a formal software development methodology of reactive systems. We include Notebook that showcases our work. It can be downloaded and open with Jupiter Notebook or Google Colab. 

We include two versions of a vehicle platooning Event-B project (a simple and a more complex model) that can be imported from Rodin version 3.5 - the Notebook includes a model of the simpler version using the Z3 API of Python.
